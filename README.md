# school-projects
This is a repository that contains many of the code projects I worked on for university courses. This README also links to external repositories for school projects that I have worked on.
# Index 
The courses are listed in chronological order, with newer projects closer to the top.
You can find more information on each project's individual README.
## Software Engineering 
This is a project that the whole of the class worked on for the duration of the course. It is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the organization and participation in soccer matches (pickup games). Additionally, it allows the creation of private groups, user communication through chats, and user permission management by administrators. I worked on both the backend and frontend of the development team.
