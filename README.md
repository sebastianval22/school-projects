## Software Engineering 
This is a project that the whole of the class worked on for the duration of the course. It is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the organization and participation in soccer matches (pickup games). Additionally, it allows the creation of private groups, user communication through chats, and user permission management by administrators. I worked on both the backend and frontend of the development team.
